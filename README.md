## üß© Adding a New Form Field

This app uses a config-driven form schema (`formConfig`) to define form fields. Adding a new field is easy and doesn't require modifying form logic.

### Step 1: Open the Form Config

Open the file where `formConfig` is defined ‚Äî typically `form-schema-config.ts`.

### Step 2: Add a New Field Entry

Each form field is defined using the following interface:

```ts
export interface IUserFormSchema {
  name: string;
  type: "TextField" | "Autocomplete";
  componet: ElementType;
  props: TextFieldProps;
  options?: string[] | Record<string, any>[];
  validation: {
    pattern?: RegExp;
    errorMessage?: string;
    minLength?: number;
    maxLength?: number;
  };
}
```

Insert a new object in the formConfig array. For example, to add a username field::

```ts
{
  name: "username",
  type: "TextField",
  componet: TextField,
  props: { label: "Username", type: "text", required: true },
  validation: {
    pattern: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$/,
    errorMessage: "Username must be 3‚Äì20 characters and can only include letters, numbers, and underscores",
  },
}
```

That‚Äôs it! Your new field will automatically appear in both the Add User and Edit User forms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Assumptions

1. **Complex validation logic** such as conditional fields (e.g., showing a field only if another field has a certain value) or dependent dropdowns are not supported out of the box. However, the current architecture is flexible enough to be extended to support such use cases.

2. It is **assumed that any new field added** is either a `TextField` or an `Autocomplete`. If you need to add custom inputs like a **date range picker**, you'll need to manually integrate it. For most basic forms, `TextField` and `Autocomplete` should suffice.
